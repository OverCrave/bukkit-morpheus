# HP Action Bar

This tiny Bukkit shows your current HP in your Action Bar when it's changes. That's all. 

# Configuration

In the `config.yml` you can select a pattern for the action bar. Here is the default `config.yml`: 

```yaml
# by what template should we show action bar.
# %s is current player's HP

bar-template: '&aYou have &c%s&a HP'
```
